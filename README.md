## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a preview of a product in the form of a **card component** and try to get it is close to the designs for mobile and desktop as possible.

The challenge allowed any tools to be used to complete the challenge.

The user should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

## The challenges I faced

Most of my time was spent trying to get the image as well as the white card component to stay at a fixed size and fixed position when scaling upwards from **375px** to **1440px**.

The smaller challenges were:

- Getting the font-family to work when the design images showed a different **font-family**, as well as the **font-weights** as those never worked properly.
- Getting the margins for the QR image to precisely position the image in the middle.

## What I learned

- I learned how to use View Height (**vh**) as a unit when it came to **min-height** and **max-height** to set constraints for big components or elements.
- I learned how to use **Flexbox** in conjunction with **height** to position an element in the center both vertically and horizontally. Horizontally was the easiest as flexbox does its magic. It took a while to get the height to work.
- Reinforcement of how to use **max-width** to keep an element at a certain width (this being the QR image, the heading and the paragraph).

## What's next

- Learning to know when to use each unit such as **em**, **percentage**, **rem** at an advanced level.
- Moving on to Responsive web design and using multiple sizes of the same image (i.e. **srcset** etc.).
- Creating a hamburger navbar for mobile.
- Animations for some elements.
- Understanding intermediate and advanced JavaScript.
- DOM manipulation.

## Deployment
